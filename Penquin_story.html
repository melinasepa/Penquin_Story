  <p> The penquin said, "I'm a guy." <br> The dog said, "I know the male penquin carries the eggs." <br> Penquin said, "Fine." <br> The penquin took out his eggs and "accidentally" made them fall towards a bunch of rocks.<br><br><img src="http://en.es-static.us/upl/2009/12/penguin-male-egg.jpg" style="width:10%"> <br><br>Then he went and collected them and handed the dog an egg. The dog handed the penquin some carrots and said, "thanks for the egg." The penguin said, "no problem" then quickly took off. Later the dog tried to eat the egg and realized it was a rock. <br><br><br> THE END </p>
